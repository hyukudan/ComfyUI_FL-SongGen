## Prompting Guide

Getting the best results requires understanding how to format lyrics and descriptions properly.

<details>
<summary><strong>Lyrics Format</strong></summary>

### Basic Structure

Lyrics use **section tags** separated by ` ; ` (space-semicolon-space) with **phrases separated by periods** `.`:

```
[intro-short] ; [verse] First line. Second line. Third line ; [chorus] Chorus line one. Chorus line two ; [outro-short]
```

### Structure Labels

**Instrumental sections** (no lyrics):

| Tag | Duration | Description |
|-----|:--------:|-------------|
| `[intro-short]` | ~0-10s | Short instrumental intro |
| `[intro-medium]` | ~10-20s | Medium instrumental intro |
| `[inst-short]` | ~0-10s | Short instrumental break |
| `[inst-medium]` | ~10-20s | Medium instrumental break |
| `[outro-short]` | ~0-10s | Short instrumental outro |
| `[outro-medium]` | ~10-20s | Medium instrumental outro |

**Lyrical sections** (lyrics required):

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `[verse]` | Verse - typically tells the story |
| `[chorus]` | Chorus - the catchy, repeated hook |
| `[bridge]` | Bridge - contrasting part before final chorus |

### Formatting Rules

1. Sections are separated by ` ; ` (with spaces)
2. Lyrics within sections are separated by periods `.`
3. Each period represents a phrase/line break
4. Do NOT add lyrics to instrumental tags

<summary><strong>Complete Song Example</strong></summary>

```
[intro-short] ; [verse] These faded memories of us. I can't erase the tears you cried before. Unchained this heart to find its way. My peace won't beg you to stay ; [chorus] Like a fool begs for supper. I find myself waiting for her. Only to find the broken pieces of my heart. That was needed for my soul to love again ; [inst-short] ; [verse] Silhouettes where you once stood. Life's rhythm changed its beat for good. Numb to whispers we once knew. My path won't circle back to you ; [chorus] Like a fool begs for supper. I find myself waiting for her. Only to find the broken pieces of my heart. That was needed for my soul to love again ; [outro-short]
```

<summary><strong>Style Transfer (Reference Audio)</strong></summary>

Use a **10-second reference audio** to guide the musical style:

- Only the **first 10 seconds** of the audio will be used
- Using the **chorus section** of a reference song works best
- Influences: genre, instrumentation, rhythm, and voice characteristics

### Combining with Descriptions

You can optionally provide a **text description** alongside reference audio to further guide the generation. This can be useful to:

- Specify voice gender when the reference audio is ambiguous
- Add specific emotions or timbres
- Set a specific BPM

> **Note:** If the description conflicts with the reference audio style, results may be unpredictable. Use complementary descriptions for best results.

<summary><strong>Tips for Better Results</strong></summary>

### Lyrics Tips

- Keep phrases **natural and singable**
- Use **repetition** strategically, especially in the chorus
- Match **syllable counts** roughly between verses
- Use **emotionally evocative** language

### Description Tips

- Use **commas** to separate attributes
- Stick to **predefined tags** for best results
- Don't overload with too many conflicting descriptors
- BPM must use the exact format: `the bpm is X`

### General Tips

- Start with shorter songs to test your prompts
- The `base_new` model is recommended for English lyrics
- Enable `low_mem` mode if you're running low on VRAM
- Instrumental sections help create natural song flow
